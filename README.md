📘 Project Overview

This Power BI project was developed during my internship at SaiKet Systems to analyze Customer Churn — the rate at which customers stop doing business with a company.
The dashboard helps visualize and understand the key factors influencing customer retention and churn behavior using interactive and data-driven insights.

🎯 Project Objective

To identify the reasons behind customer churn by analyzing factors such as contract type, payment method, internet service, demographics, and tenure, enabling better retention strategies and decision-making.
